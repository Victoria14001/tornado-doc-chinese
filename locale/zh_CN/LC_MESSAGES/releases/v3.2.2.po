"The XSRF token is now encoded with a random mask on each request. This "
"makes it safe to include in compressed pages without being vulnerable to "
"the `BREACH attack <http://breachattack.com>`_. This applies to most "
"applications that use both the ``xsrf_cookies`` and ``gzip`` options (or "
"have gzip applied by a proxy)."

"used for a transitional period to generate the older cookie format on "
"newer servers."
