"``tornado.autoreload`` --- Automatically detect code changes in "
"development"
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload:1
msgid "Automatically restart the server when a source file is modified."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload:3
msgid ""
"Most applications should not access this module directly.  Instead, pass "
"the keyword argument ``autoreload=True`` to the `tornado.web.Application`"
" constructor (or ``debug=True``, which enables this setting and several "
"others).  This will enable autoreload mode as well as checking for "
"changes to templates and static resources.  Note that restarting is a "
"destructive operation and any requests in progress will be aborted when "
"the process restarts.  (If you want to disable autoreload while using "
"other debug-mode features, pass both ``debug=True`` and "
"``autoreload=False``)."

#: of tornado.autoreload:13
msgid ""
"This module can also be used as a command-line wrapper around scripts "
"such as unit test runners.  See the `main` method for details."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload:16
msgid ""
"The command-line wrapper and Application debug modes can be used "
"together. This combination is encouraged as the wrapper catches syntax "
"errors and other import-time failures, while debug mode catches changes "
"once the server has started."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload:21
msgid ""
"This module will not work correctly when `.HTTPServer`'s multi-process "
"mode is used."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload:24
msgid ""
"Reloading loses any Python interpreter command-line arguments (e.g. "
"``-u``) because it re-executes Python using ``sys.executable`` and "
"``sys.argv``. Additionally, modifying these variables will cause "
"reloading to behave incorrectly."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload.start:1
msgid "Begins watching source files for changes."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload.start:3
msgid "The ``io_loop`` argument (deprecated since version 4.1) has been removed."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload.wait:1
msgid "Wait for a watched file to change, then restart the process."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload.wait:3
msgid ""
"Intended to be used at the end of scripts like unit test runners, to run "
"the tests again after any source file changes (but see also the command-"
"line interface in `main`)"
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload.watch:1
msgid "Add a file to the watch list."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload.watch:3
msgid "All imported modules are watched by default."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload.add_reload_hook:1
msgid "Add a function to be called before reloading the process."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload.add_reload_hook:3
msgid ""
"Note that for open file and socket handles it is generally preferable to "
"set the ``FD_CLOEXEC`` flag (using `fcntl` or `os.set_inheritable`) "
"instead of using a reload hook to close them."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload.main:1
msgid "Command-line wrapper to re-run a script whenever its source changes."
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload.main:3
msgid "Scripts may be specified by filename or module name::"
msgstr ""

#: of tornado.autoreload.main:8
msgid ""
"Running a script with this wrapper is similar to calling "
"`tornado.autoreload.wait` at the end of the script, but this wrapper can "
"catch import-time problems like syntax errors that would otherwise "
"prevent the script from reaching its call to `wait`."
