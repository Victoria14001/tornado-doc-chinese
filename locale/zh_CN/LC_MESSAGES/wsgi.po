"This module provides WSGI support via the `WSGIContainer` class, which "
"makes it possible to run applications using other WSGI frameworks on the "
"Tornado HTTP server. The reverse is not supported; the Tornado "
"`.Application` and `.RequestHandler` classes are designed for use with "
"the Tornado `.HTTPServer` and cannot be used in a generic WSGI container."

"WSGI is a *synchronous* interface, while Tornado's concurrency model is "
"based on single-threaded asynchronous execution.  This means that running"
" a WSGI app with Tornado's `WSGIContainer` is *less scalable* than "
"running the same app in a multi-threaded WSGI server like ``gunicorn`` or"
" ``uwsgi``.  Use `WSGIContainer` only when there are benefits to "
"combining Tornado and WSGI in the same process that outweigh the reduced "
"scalability."
