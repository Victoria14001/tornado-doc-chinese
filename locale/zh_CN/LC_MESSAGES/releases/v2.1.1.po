"Fixed handling of closed connections with the ``epoll`` (i.e. Linux) "
"``IOLoop``.  Previously, closed connections could be shut down too early,"
" which most often manifested as \"Stream is closed\" exceptions in "
"``SimpleAsyncHTTPClient``."

"Fixed a case in which chunked responses could be closed prematurely, "
"leading to truncated output."

msgid ""
"``IOStream.connect`` now reports errors more consistently via logging and"
" the close callback (this affects e.g. connections to localhost on "
"FreeBSD)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/v2.1.1.rst:19
msgid "``IOStream.read_bytes`` again accepts both ``int`` and ``long`` arguments."

"``PeriodicCallback`` no longer runs repeatedly when ``IOLoop`` iterations"
" complete faster than the resolution of ``time.time()`` (mainly a problem"
" on Windows)."

msgid ""
"Listening for ``IOLoop.ERROR`` alone is no longer sufficient for "
"detecting closed connections on an otherwise unused socket.  "
"``IOLoop.ERROR`` must always be used in combination with ``READ`` or "
"``WRITE``."
