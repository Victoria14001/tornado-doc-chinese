"The signed-value format used by `.RequestHandler.set_secure_cookie` and "
"`.RequestHandler.get_secure_cookie` has changed to be more secure. **This"
" is a disruptive change**.  The ``secure_cookie`` functions take new "
"``version`` parameters to support transitions between cookie formats."

"The new cookie format fixes a vulnerability that may be present in "

"prefix of the name of another."

"To minimize disruption, cookies in the older format will be accepted by "
"default until they expire.  Applications that may be vulnerable can "
"reject all cookies in the older format by passing ``min_version=2`` to "

"Signed cookies issued by `.RequestHandler.set_secure_cookie` in Tornado "

"`.RequestHandler.set_secure_cookie` to issue cookies that are backwards-"
"compatible (but have a known weakness, so this option should only be used"
" for a transitional period)."

"The C extension used to speed up the websocket module now compiles "
