"The new async/await keywords in Python 3.5 are supported. In most cases, "
"``async def`` can be used in place of the ``@gen.coroutine`` decorator. "
"Inside a function defined with ``async def``, use ``await`` instead of "
"``yield`` to wait on an asynchronous operation. Coroutines defined with "
"async/await will be faster than those defined with ``@gen.coroutine`` and"
" ``yield``, but do not support some features including "
"`.Callback`/`.Wait` or the ability to yield a Twisted ``Deferred``. See "
":ref:`the users' guide <native_coroutines>` for more."
